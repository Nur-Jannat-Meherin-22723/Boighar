The name of this Project is Boighor. It is my 3-2 Software Design Patterns Lab project with my Lab Partner Fatematuzzohra Prity. Boighor is totally based on Object Oriented Concept. Frontend Language is HTML with Bootstap framework using jsp files and the backend language is Java especially Advance java servlet. For database we've used mysql server and mysql workbench.
